# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  how_it_works: "A fully digital implementation of an RGB LED driver that accepts the WS2812 protocol for data input. The design is fully clocked, so the timing parameters of the protocol depend on the clock rate. A pulse between 1 and 5 clock cycles on the input will be interpreted as a zero, longer pulses as a one. Each driver accepts 3x8=24 bit of input data to set the brightness of LED1,LED2 and LED3 (R,G,B). After 24 bit have been received, additional input bits are retimed and forwarded to the data output.

  After the data input was idle for 96 clock cycles, the input data is latched into the PWM engine and the data input is ready for the next data frame.

  The PWM engine uses a special dithering scheme to allow flicker free LED dimming even for relatively low clock rates.
